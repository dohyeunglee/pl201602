(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (fold_constants_com_sound)  *)
(** Complete the [WHILE] case of the following proof. *)

Theorem fold_constants_com_sound :
  ctrans_sound fold_constants_com.
Proof.
  unfold ctrans_sound. intros c.
  induction c; simpl.
  - (* SKIP *) apply refl_cequiv.
  - (* ::= *) apply CAss_congruence.
              apply fold_constants_aexp_sound.
  - (* ;; *) apply CSeq_congruence; assumption.
  - (* IFB *)
    assert (bequiv b (fold_constants_bexp b)). {
      apply fold_constants_bexp_sound. }
    destruct (fold_constants_bexp b) eqn:Heqb;
      try (apply CIf_congruence; assumption).

      (** (If the optimization doesn't eliminate the if, then the
          result is easy to prove from the IH and
          [fold_constants_bexp_sound].) *)

    + (* b always true *)
      apply trans_cequiv with c1; try assumption.
      apply IFB_true; assumption.
    + (* b always false *)
      apply trans_cequiv with c2; try assumption.
      apply IFB_false; assumption.
  - (* WHILE *)
    exact FILL_IN_HERE.
Qed.
